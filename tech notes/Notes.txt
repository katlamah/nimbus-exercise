TOPIC  :  How Activiti is used in the framework for BPM

Activiti is an open source BPM provided by Apache, Nimbus has integrated the Activiti BPM to hide some of the boiler plate code and hide the complexity of the integration.
	Nimbus utilzes the opensource jar     <activiti-spring-boot.version>6.0.0.Beta4</activiti-spring-boot.version> which is configured inside the Nimbus-parent module pom.xml.
	Configuration for the BPM engine is done via the class BPMEngineConfig, which has the setup for DB,definitions,rules and custom deployers.
	Each active Definition is registered as a bean inside the spring-boot , ActivitiProcessAsBeanRegistrar does the job of registering the beans with spring boot.
	
	DefaultProcessConfig class provides all the bean definitions required for the Activiti.
	
	ActivitiBPMGateway provides major functionality of the BPM process  start of the process etc.
